    <!-- Okay, so the code we wrote in last lecture was not production ready. How we make our code production ready??
        we need to minify our code, optimize it, remove consoles and comments, bundle it..
        * bundler (webpack, parcel, vite etc.)
        what it does is, it combines and package multiple files and dependencies in a single optimized file. 
        we are going to use parcel in our projects, it is a package... 
        how do we get a package inside our app? -> using a package manager.. 
        ! npm -> is a node package manager.. open source library
        ! noooooo, npm doesn't stands for node package manager, it is anything but node package manager
        *  yarn -> it is also a package manager
     -->

     <!-- * we created our own react app, without using creat react app command -->

     <script type="module" src="Ignition.js">
        // here we specified the type module.. bcoz in our Ignition.js file, we imported react from react module, now that file is not a regular js file but a module. So, we have to inform our sript tags also that we are using a module...
     </script>
